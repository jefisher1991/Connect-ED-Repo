# Connect-ED-Repo
Project one App to connect class and instructor

This app was built by a small group of students at the NU Coding Boot Camp in roughly 2 weeks. 

We employed a variety of technologies including Firebase, Google Charts, Bootstrap, HTML5, and CSS3. 

The following are some of the primary functionalities of our project:

	— Ability to update teacher on “comprehension” of
	lecture material using rating (1 - 5)
	— Data visualization to display real-time results from
	students, using a line graph
	- Professional-caliber user interface, guided by Twitter 	Bootstrap framework, and talented web developers
