# Connect-ED-Repo
Project one App to connect class and instructor

This app was built by a small group of students at the NU Coding Boot Camp in roughly 2 weeks. 

We employed a variety of technologies including Firebase, Google Charts, Bootstrap, HTML5, and CSS3. 

Due to the time constraints on the project, we focused on a couple of major concerns. They included the following:

1) Ability for student to provide “comprehension” rating (1 - 5) during the course of the lecture

2) Displaying a data visualization of these results in real-time

3) A professional grade user-interface guided by Twitter Bootstrap and 
the hard work of some talented web developers
